If you do not have a C++ compiler installed, install with the following command in your linux system.
```
sudo apt install g++ -y
```

**Additional Note:** for constant values I am using the character `@` for variable with exponent of 0.

## TEST
to test the code, just run `test.sh` from your shell. Make sure you have g++ installed.
