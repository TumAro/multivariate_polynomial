## Current Task

**ATOMS**
- [x] multiplicative inverse
- [x] equality test
- [x] mult operator


**Particle**
- [x] multiply by atom
- [x] divide by atom
- [x] structural equality
- [x] negate operation (unary)
- [x] Particle = atom * atom (when different var)


**Polynom**
- [x] Polynom unary negetion
- [x] Polynom (+, -, *) atom
- [x] Polynom (+, -, *) particle
- [x] partial evaluation (substitue some vars)
- [x] Polynom = particle + particle (when different varmap)
- [x] Polnom = atom + atom (when different vars)
- [ ] Polynom -> degree, leading term
- [ ] Equality check
- [ ] Number of variables

**Input Output**
- [x] array -> polynom (univariate)
- [x] polynom -> array (univariate)
- [ ] lexicographic scale up

**LA**
- [x] Polynom matrix struct

**Determinant**
- [x] 2x2 det
- [x] 3x3 det
- [ ] ?scale up to larger det?
- [ ] recursive cofactor
- [ ] LU decompostion

## LATER
 
[ ] - !real number inputs
[ ] - precision on float values
[ ] - Kronecker mult (if speed needed)  
[ ] - boost library to precision and enchancment
[ ] - Growbner basis operation  
[ ] - Lin Transform  
[ ] - Resultant of Polynomials
