## Current Task

**ATOMS**
- [x] multiplicative inverse
- [x] equality test
- [x] mult operator


**Particle**
- [x] multiply by atom
- [x] divide by atom
- [x] structural equality
- [x] negate operation (unary)


**Polynom**
- [ ] Polyom * particle
- [ ] Polynom + particle
- [ ] Polynom - particle
- [ ] POlynom -> degree, leading term
- [ ] Multiply by particle (distributive)
- [ ] partial evaluation (substitue some vars)
