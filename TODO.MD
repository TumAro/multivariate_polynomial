## Current Task

**ATOMS**
- [x] multiplicative inverse
- [x] equality test
- [x] mult operator


**Particle**
- [x] multiply by atom
- [x] divide by atom
- [x] structural equality
- [x] negate operation (unary)
- [x] Particle = atom * atom (when different var)


**Polynom**
- [x] Polynom unary negetion
- [x] Polynom (+, -, *) atom
- [x] Polynom (+, -, *) particle
- [x] partial evaluation (substitue some vars)
- [x] Polynom = particle + particle (when different varmap)
- [x] Polnom = atom + atom (when different vars)
- [ ] Polynom -> degree, leading term
- [ ] Equality check
