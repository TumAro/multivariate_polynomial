Input type:

Q. input structure? + how?
array of coefficients. lexicographic or reverse
commercial normally use reverse.
for no coeff user puts zero
x^3yz^2 + 3xy^3 -> based on indexing on lexic or reverse lex

Q. string? -> normally str in c/c++

Q. expectations?
accuracy of computation

Q. output structure? -> coeff list

Q. what kind of future computation:
polynom arithmatic in multvar
determinant comp -> for now univariate case


# note
when doing det. -> when testing -> accuracy
for random real number not only integers
keep in mind: decimal accuracy
0.1 * 0.5 -> 0.05 -> make sure precision is not ommitted

boost library -> check it out -> for enhancement for precision
large dimension determinant -> calculation formulas
-> for now try simple case
